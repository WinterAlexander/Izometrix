# Izometrix
An Isometric test game/prototype made only to study the world of isometry aka semi 3D or 2.5D

I made this game a while ago with a friend. This friend was only doing the graphics.

This project had for purpose for him to discover isometrics graphics and to me to learn how to do an isometric game.


Now, I decided to work on it again so I uploaded it on github and started refactoring some classes.
I might integrate the game a bit more into libgdx also, back then I wasn't that comfortable with libgdx so I
built my game without using most of the libgdx classes and features. That explains why I did my own camera (IsometricDrawer)
instead of learning how to use the libgdx's one. In fact this game could of been made with any library such as swing or slick2d
since it is only using the render part.
